  "body": "## Welcome to the Response Onset Tool\r\nThis tool, written in Matlab, helps you process your audiofiles from your experiment. Essentially, it tells you when the subjects verbal response to a stimulus sets in.\r\nWith this Matlab tool, we aim to help others determine the response onset in their experiment data (audio).\r\n\r\n### About the project\r\nOriginally, we only looked toward an easy way to help us determine the verbal response onset in an audio file. However, as we looked to automate as much of the process as possible, things quickly became more involved. Additionally, we realised the help this tool might provide to others in the same situation.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe Response Onset Tool was (and is) developed by:\r\n* Volker Reisner\r\n* David Hinrichs (@davhin)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the tool? Check out the [github repo](https://github.com/davhin/ResponseOnsetTool) and open an issue. Please note, that the Response Onset Tool is still in alpha-phase and undergoes heavy development as of fall '16. \r\n",
